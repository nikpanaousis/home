        <div class="box other">Those little scratch-off cardboard possibilities made him giddy with excitement. Out to the parking lot, we saddle up on a retaining wall with our bounty. That day was not our lucky day. As I remember, we had zero winners. I remember my dad being sad and frumpy. I said nothing. He tried to show me part of his world, which gave him hope. And I remember feeling embarrassed by how he acted.

Now it is too late. Too late to be tender. Too late to express love. I let my chance to soothe my dad's suffering slip away. I regret not hugging my dad in that 7-Eleven parking lot. </div>
